      The 'obliteration' of an object, the decomposition and deconstruction of
      it's systemic and cultural canons. What did this manifest as for paper? An
      invention that I believe would have materialized in every timeline of
      human existance. It's effects on the world incomprehensable and it's
      origins sylvan. If your birth certificate, passport, ID, work permit,
      study permit, diplomas, drivers license, social security card, heath
      insurance, will, Marriage certificate ceased to exist. What are you then?
      You are certainly not any of the things listed. You aren't eligible to
      travel, eligible for healthcare, married, educated or born. What are we if
      not government documents. In "Seeing like a state", James C. Scott, writes
      about the significance of paper documentation. How the state relies on
      standardizing and making our lives <em>legible</em> so that we are easier
      to govern and dominate. In the process, nuance of our lives are lost. We
      are conditioned to live within the constraints of what the government has
      written down for us. Parchment Echo is an experimental film inspired by
      <a href="http://kinet.media/index/isaac-goes">Issac Goes</a>. It serves as
      a dialouge between my identity as a Pakistani immigrant unfixed between
      Dubai and Canada. The film consistes of found footage from WWI, WWII, The
      partition of Hindustan and my own found footage from past moments in my
      life. Most of the footage is not directly imported from a camera. Instead,
      it is scanned or turned into stop motion mixed media as a constraint to
      work with the medium of paper internally as well as externally. The
      dialouge in urdu was recorded by my mother where she talks about meeting
      her nana (het late mother's brother) who got permission from the Indian
      government to travel to Pakistan in 2023, along with a voiceover of me
      reading out a summary of my finding from "Seeing like a state".
